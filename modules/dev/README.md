# What is this for?

Because bloatware sucks and nix sometimes leaves alot of garbage, I decided to make each project a
seperate nix file.

# How do I use this?

- copy project-template.nix
- add package dependencies to it
  - when you dont maintain that project anymore you can delete the file and rebuild

# Add language?

- just make a nix file and add that yeah
